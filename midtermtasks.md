In group discussion we decided that the midterm project should be a group collaborative project that tests our knowledge of collaboration and git. We felt that two weeks would be adequate to complete this assignment as we would be collaborating outside class. Individual tasks we propose for the midterm include:
* Go in depth in features from Q8 and diagram them using draw.io. We will do sequence and activity diagrams for these features.
* Pick 2 additional features to add to yo. Storyboard these features using AdobeXD.
* List nonfunctional requirements for these additional features
* Use cases for these features
* All members of the group will commit changes in their own branch using git and merge into master
